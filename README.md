## General info

This is a pretty simple SPA (Single Page Application) made with React. Feel free to use it for yourself! Shout out
to [Nirmalya Ghosh's](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nirmalyaghosh.com) template where I took most of the styling
for this site. Thank you :innocent:

## Technologies

- Javascript
- React
- React testing library
- React Router

## Setup

In a strange world where you'd like to copy my own personal site - to which you are very welcome by the way - you would clone this repository and then just run:

```
npm test
npm start
```
